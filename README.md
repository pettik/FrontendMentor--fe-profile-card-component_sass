## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my very 1st time Code challenge from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">FrontendMentor site</a> Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. .
But this time I come with SASS and I re-create the first challenge with Sass components to pratice my Sass skills.

## Overview

### The challenge

My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. I found both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that I needed to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.
